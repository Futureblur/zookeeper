# 🐪 Zookeeper
This is a small project from [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/196?track=18) that helped me learn the basics of Kotlin.<br>
You can find the working source file [here](https://github.com/Futureblur/zookeeper/blob/master/Zookeeper/task/src/Zookeeper.kt).

### What can you do with it?

Once you run the program, you can enter numbers ranging from 0 to 5 to view the animal in the zoo.<br>
To exit the program, simply type `exit`.
